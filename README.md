Personal Finance Management System

### Project Idea: Personal Finance Management System

#### Overview
Build a cloud-native, event-driven microservices application that helps users manage their finances by tracking transactions, setting budgets, generating spending insights, and providing real-time notifications. The system will use Spring Boot for microservices, Kafka or RabbitMQ for event-driven communication, and a cloud provider for deployment (e.g., AWS ECS, Azure AKS, or GCP Cloud Run).

#### Key Features
1. **User Management**: Register and manage user profiles.
2. **Transaction Processing**: Record and categorize financial transactions (e.g., income, expenses) in real-time.
3. **Budget Management**: Set monthly budgets for categories (e.g., groceries, utilities) with alerts for overspending.
4. **Financial Insights**: Generate reports and insights (e.g., spending patterns, savings goals) using aggregated data.
5. **Real-Time Notifications**: Notify users of transactions, budget limits, or anomalies via email or push notifications.
6. **Currency Conversion**: Support multi-currency transactions with real-time exchange rates (using an external API).
7. **Audit Logging**: Track all financial activities for transparency and compliance.

#### Microservices Architecture
Break the system into loosely coupled microservices, each handling a specific domain. Use an event-driven approach to ensure scalability and asynchronous communication.

1. **User Service**:
   - Manages user registration, authentication, and profiles.
   - Tech: Spring Boot, Spring Security (JWT/OAuth2), PostgreSQL.
   - Events: Publishes `UserCreatedEvent`, `UserUpdatedEvent`.

2. **Transaction Service**:
   - Handles creation, categorization, and retrieval of transactions.
   - Tech: Spring Boot, MongoDB (for high-throughput transaction data).
   - Events: Publishes `TransactionCreatedEvent`, subscribes to `UserCreatedEvent` for validation.

3. **Budget Service**:
   - Manages budget creation, updates, and threshold alerts.
   - Tech: Spring Boot, Redis (for fast budget lookups).
   - Events: Subscribes to `TransactionCreatedEvent` to update budget status, publishes `BudgetThresholdBreachedEvent`.

4. **Notification Service**:
   - Sends real-time alerts (email, SMS, or push) for transactions or budget limits.
   - Tech: Spring Boot, Spring Cloud Stream (Kafka/RabbitMQ), integration with Twilio or SendGrid.
   - Events: Subscribes to `TransactionCreatedEvent`, `BudgetThresholdBreachedEvent`.

5. **Analytics Service**:
   - Generates financial insights and reports (e.g., spending trends, savings progress).
   - Tech: Spring Boot, Elasticsearch (for analytics), Apache Spark (optional for large-scale data processing).
   - Events: Subscribes to `TransactionCreatedEvent` for real-time analytics.

6. **Currency Service**:
   - Fetches real-time exchange rates and converts transactions.
   - Tech: Spring Boot, external API (e.g., ExchangeRate-API).
   - Events: Publishes `CurrencyConvertedEvent`.

7. **Audit Service**:
   - Logs all activities for compliance and debugging.
   - Tech: Spring Boot, MongoDB or AWS S3 for logs.
   - Events: Subscribes to all events for logging.

#### Event-Driven Architecture
- **Message Broker**: Use Kafka or RabbitMQ for event streaming.
  - Example: When a transaction is created (`TransactionCreatedEvent`), the Budget Service updates the budget, the Analytics Service processes trends, and the Notification Service sends an alert.
- **Event Store**: Persist events in a database (e.g., MongoDB) for event sourcing or auditing.
- **Spring Cloud Stream**: Simplify event publishing/subscribing with Kafka or RabbitMQ binders.

#### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Spring Boot, Spring Cloud (for microservices), Spring Security, Spring Data (JPA, MongoDB, Redis).
- **Database**:
  - PostgreSQL (User Service, relational data).
  - MongoDB (Transaction and Audit Services, high-throughput data).
  - Redis (Budget Service, caching).
  - Elasticsearch (Analytics Service, reporting).
- **Message Broker**: Kafka or RabbitMQ.
- **Cloud Deployment**:
  - AWS: ECS/EKS for containers, RDS for PostgreSQL, ElastiCache for Redis, MSK for Kafka.
  - Azure: AKS, Cosmos DB (MongoDB API), Azure Cache for Redis.
  - GCP: Cloud Run, Firestore, Cloud Pub/Sub.
- **API Gateway**: Spring Cloud Gateway or AWS API Gateway for routing and load balancing.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions or Jenkins for automated deployment to the cloud.
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, or cloud-native tools (e.g., AWS CloudWatch).
- **External APIs**: ExchangeRate-API or OpenExchangeRates for currency conversion.

#### Deployment Workflow
1. **Containerization**: Package each microservice as a Docker container.
2. **Orchestration**: Use Kubernetes (EKS/AKS/GKE) or serverless options like AWS ECS/Cloud Run.
3. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Build: Maven/Gradle for Spring Boot.
   - Test: JUnit, Testcontainers for integration testing.
   - Deploy: Push Docker images to a registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR) and deploy to the cloud.
4. **Scalability**: Configure auto-scaling for microservices based on load (e.g., Kubernetes HPA).
5. **Security**: Use OAuth2 for authentication, encrypt sensitive data, and secure APIs with HTTPS.

#### Capstone Deliverables
1. **Source Code**: A GitHub repository with well-documented Spring Boot microservices.
2. **Architecture Diagram**: Visualize microservices, event flows, and cloud infrastructure.
3. **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger for REST endpoints.
4. **Deployment Guide**: Instructions for deploying on a chosen cloud provider.
5. **Demo**: A working prototype with sample transactions, budgets, and notifications.
6. **Report**: A detailed report covering architecture, design decisions, challenges, and future enhancements.

#### Challenges to Address
- **Eventual Consistency**: Handle data consistency across microservices using event-driven patterns.
- **Scalability**: Ensure the system handles high transaction volumes with Kafka partitioning or RabbitMQ queues.
- **Security**: Protect sensitive financial data with encryption and secure APIs.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Implement circuit breakers (e.g., Resilience4j) and retries for external API failures.

#### Future Enhancements
- Integrate machine learning for predictive budgeting or anomaly detection.
- Add a frontend (e.g., React, Angular) for user interaction.
- Support investment tracking (e.g., stocks, crypto) with real-time market data.
